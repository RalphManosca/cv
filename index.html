  <p>I am an introvert ever since i was a kid and overcoming it was difficult for me because most of the time the work i get hired for requires communication with other people, to my surprise i excelled on it not that i don’t prefer being introverted
    anymore but with the right motivation and mind set you can excel with anything.Most of the time i use my time researching and taking my time to learn something new everyday including ways to improve myself and new ways to make money.
    My hobbies include playing games when i need to unwind and prevent burn out.</p>
